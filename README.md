Description

Team has provided me a library containing all the required Trading Algo software and the job is to execute the Algo when given a ‘signal’ which is Integer value
SignalHandler Interface and Algo java class provided as third party library

‘Application’ class has code to be able to process one of these signals. ‘Application’ class code only has three signals,
Implemented code so the new signal is scalable to except new incoming signals.
